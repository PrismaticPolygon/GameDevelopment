# GameDevelopment

Goal: to develop a hide-and-seek treasure game, based in the Durham university campus. 

Idea: a top-down shooter, based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsk-HSGFjnaGQq7ybM8Lgkh5EMxUWPm2i) 
Youtube tutorial, adapted for Durham, and with the inclusion of treasure collection.

Story: a quantum computing experiment has opened a hellish portal, Ã  la Doom. The player
must find 10 q-bits around campus to shut down the portal. 

### TODO

Three sprints

1. Minimum viable product
    * Create a ground-floor Engineering map.
    * Create an 'outside' Science Site map.
    * Implement level traversal.
    
2. Maximise marks
    * Switch to mouse pointing / aiming
    * Add a field of view
    * Improve zombie pathfinding ([tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3gbNOl4DiM))
    * Add zombie states (chasing, roaming)
     
3. Nice-to-haves
    * Melee attacks ([tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaJopFFkmNo))
    * Weapon accuracy decreases with movement
    * Add animations
    * Add physics-based weapons (e.g. a grenade)
    * Destructible obstacles (doors / windows)
    * Floating combat text
    * More particle effects (fire, smoke)
    * Items (ammunition, armour)

## Marks

#### Game design [10]

* Game goals
* Game type

#### Core development [30]

* Game scene (visual representation, internal data structure)
* Game flow / progression (navigation, screen scrolling, levels)
* Game interaction (action detection, response generation)
* Game objects (use of sprites, animations, multimedia)

#### Game mechanics [30]

* Game rules / logic
* Game challenges

#### Use of game engine [30]

* Engine choice (pyGame, Unity)
* User input (keyboard, mouse, joystick)
* Game object interaction (event triggering, collision detection)
* Incorporation of multimedia content
* Other features (assets, external libraries)

#### Demonstrate creativity [15]

* Game economy (support to game type, game feedback, game difficulty)
* Advanced interaction (game physics, object tracking, steering behaviour)
